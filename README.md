You can read about different aspects of the current Congress of the United States with general member information such as 
FULL NAME, WEB SITE, STATE, SENIORITY and PERTENTAGE OF VOTES. You can filter out the data table by State and Party. 

In the Attendance section you can find a glance at the general information of each party and below the tables of percentage of 
MISSED VOTES. Here the client wanted to know which members were the 10% most and least enganged in the Congress matters. 

In the Loyalty section you can find data tables with percentage of votes with party. The client wanted to find the top 10% and bottom 
10% of members who voted with the party. 

The data is recieved live through an AJAX call to the Pro Publica Web site: https://www.propublica.org/

The technologies used were HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery.
